gmail.py
========

This script uses Google's atom feed to retrieve unread messages in your gmail
account. urllib takes care of the username and password handling, since I
figure they'd do a better/safer job of it that I could.

*NOTE*
	Taken from the urllib documentation page, regarding urllib.open():
	Warning: When opening HTTPS URLs, it does not attempt to validate the
	server certificate. Use at your own risk!

The last line in gmail.py:
	print '%s at %s: %s <%s> wrote "%s"' % (sdate, stime, \
	k.find(name).text, k.find(email).text, k.find(title).text)
is what actually prints the output and can easily be changed with even a
rudementary understanding of Python for different formats.

If any other information is required from the XML file, the variables defined
towards the end with purl.org in their string can be used.
